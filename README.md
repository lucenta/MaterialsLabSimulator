# Materials Lab Simulator #

### Description ###
A simulation tool written in Python 3 designed for a first year engineering course at McMaster University. The tool consists of two interactive simulations. The first is a mechanical workshop simulation. The simulation allows users to cold roll a piece of aluminum, and then subject that piece of aluminum to a tensile test. The second is a thermocouple simulation. The simulation allows users to modify the two metals that make up the thermocouple as well as adjust the temperature at the node of the thermocouple. The voltage is measured across the thermocouple and displayed to the user.

### Installation & Running ###
The only external library needed to be installed is matplotlib. Use pip to install matplotlib. To run the program, simply run the main.py file. **NOTE: Issues with the tkinter library and mac will cause some display issues. Please run with windows !**
